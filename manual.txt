How to split a .vox model
 1) Drag .vox file into VOX-Splitter folder (containing the voxsplitter.py script)
 2) Open folder in command line
 3) Run script using
	
	py <python3 version> voxsplitter.py <.vox file name> <number of clusters> 

	e.g.: py -3.6 voxsplitter.py car.vox 10

 4) Create new empty project in MagicaVoxel
 5) Change to object viewer (press TAB)
 6) Drag and Drop the .vox files generated by the script into the Editor 
 7) Load color pallet
 8)Safe (Naming convention: <name of object> + “_broken”


How to create an destructible asset

 1) Create a complete and a broken version of the model
 2) Import them into the Unity project (into Assets/Resources/Models/Breakables/)
 3) Create Prefab of broken version:
   3.1) Use VoxelToUnity to generate prefab (into Assets/Resources/Prefabs/Breakables/)
   3.2) Open Prefab in Prefab editor (right-click -> Open)
   3.3) Set layer of main object (and subsequent all child objects)
   3.4) Assign mesh collider to all parts (mark as convex)
   3.5) Assign Rigidbody to all parts that should move
   3.6) Assign Parts_Despawn script to all parts that should despawn
   Tipp: components can be assigned to multiple objects at once by selecting them all in the hierarchy tab
 4) Create Prefab of complete version
   4.1) Add collider (mesh collider if object to complex, (multiple) box or sphere collider otherwise)
   4.2) Add Destruction script
   4.3) Assign broken prefab to “Broken_version” field
   4.4) Set desired health/regeneration
